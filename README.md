# Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch

This repository is a collection of **Deep Learning application projects** using **PyTorch** I have learned through series 'Deep Learning with PyTorch' provided by DataCamp. 

The main goal is to strengthen fundamental knowledge of Deep Learning, get familiar with PyTorch and apply into real-world use cases. The projects cover diverse input types: structured data, sequences, images, text using multiple deep learning models (CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, Transformers) to tackle a variety tasks such as classification, prediction,... 

Along the way, applying real-world projects, tinkering with tensors, dealing with preprocessing data and evaluating helps me to learn a lot. Check my [mini project experiment on Substack blog](https://quynhanhphuong.substack.com/s/one-more-experiment) for more detailed experiments.
